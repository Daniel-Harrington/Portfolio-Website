The website takes in a prompt to complete the phrase "How to ___ :" and python is used to structure the request to gpt in a way it gives consistently formatted replies. Each step is then fed into DALL-E, the prompts are reprocessed to attempt less error-prone images in response. All of the responses are then returned to construct the WikiHow-style page.<br \><br/><br/>Initially I found the theme of relying on gpt's API a bit too simple, but after doing it myself and having students try their own hand at applying the api, I found that there is definitely still unexplored applications as this technogy becomes more prevalent.<br/><br/>The 3-hour time crunch and GPT theme constraint gave me a renewed appreciation for finding ways to innovate on the basics through their application rather than just their technical makeup.<br/><br/>This project gave an opportunity to challenge the drawbacks of current LLMs and and try to overcome them algorithmically. Takeaways are that double-entendres are to be avoided as they most often lead to unpredictable (and sometimes comedic) results<br/><br/>In addition to the time and technical constraints, I found being chosen to lead the team put me in a unique position to make the most of my groupmates varied abilities. I am happy to say my teaching experience helped tremendously in this regard and I was able to break of the tasks efficiently.<br/><br/><br/>I definitely could not gotten runner-up own my own and I am thankful to my wonderful team!</p></div><div class="column"><h4>(Below) - Some Examples of Generated Articles.</h4><img style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1089305479873839169/1143035644076097556/autohow1.png"/> <img style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1089305479873839169/1089611311383576586/image.png"/> <img style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1089305479873839169/1089611376965718217/image.png?width=478&height=676"/></div></div></div></section><section id="skills-area" class="post-container"><div class="post-header"><h1>My Skills - Area Under Construction</h1><p>I have been lucky in that the many jobs I worked outside of tech I believe have prepared me well for the field.
