You will likely notice that, just like this website; I tend towards learning and experimenting with unique technologies. Though the technically difficulty of these projects varies greatly, I believe there is also alot to be learned from implementing simple technologies creatively in addition to understanding the technically complex.</p><div class="grid-container"><div class="grid-item"><a href="#website">Portfolio Website</a></div><div class="grid-item"><a href="#AR">AR Hand-Tracking</a></div><div class="grid-item"><a href="#website">Voronoi Map Generation</a></div><div class="grid-item"><a href="#AR">SDL2 Game Development</a></div><div class="grid-item"><a href="#AR">AI Generated WikiHow</a></div><div class="grid-item"><a href="#AR">Accessible Client Interface</a></div><div class="grid-item"><a href="#AR">NHL Game Prediction</a></div><div class="grid-item"><a href="#AR">Turtle Graphics in C</a></div><div class="grid-item"><a href="#AR">Schedule Comparison Social Media App</a></div></div><h2 id="website">#This Website - Status: Ongoing</h2><h3>Technologies Used : JS,Three.js,HTML,CSS,Git</h3><h4>Notable Feature Summary:<br \>- Performant on web and mobile despite extensive 3d rendering<br \>- Quaternion based day/night cycle, accelerated by scrolling<br \>- Modular section tiles including camera and tile translations<br \></h4><div class="row"><div class="column"><p>This website went through quite a few initial design iterations but the goals were always the same:<br \><br \>- Learn Git and Manage a Larger projects<br \>- Learn Three.JS using almost soley documentation<br \>- Create something unique that would make people say "I've never seen a website like that"<br \><br \>This project took about a month and I learned alot about using Git safely to maintain the project (After breaking it quite a few times). I wanted to focus on learning through documentation to be better prepared for using technologies that were too obscure to have many tutorials or forum solutions, I ran into a few issue but overall it went smoothly and it was an enjoyable jump into webGL's capabilities.<br \><br \>My big takeaways from this project were more robust workflow practices, an appreciation for quaternions and practice compartmentalizing issues across a broader program. In the future I think i would work to seperate the components further as in the end many components did end up relying on eachother cyclically.</p></div><div class="column"><br/><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uPVaR4vkwpw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/><br/><h4>(Above) - An early iteration of the websites background using a lit texture mapped along a sinusoidal function, unfortunately the isolating the lighting of just the background from the rest of the scene would have added too much overhead to the project, and I think the final space-themed version better represents me anyways.</h4></div></div><h2 id="AR">#Exam Buddy - Status: Completed</h2><h3>Technologies Used : Python,Google Mediapipe</h3><h4>Notable Feature Summary:<br \>- Capable of handling many hands in frame<br \>- Requires only a minimally-specced latop and laptop webcam<br \>- Handling of inverted hands<br \></h4><div class="row"><div class="column"><p>The goal of this small project was to get some hand on experience applying computer vision as well as some linear algebra concepts.<br/>The face is drawn to a polygon that has been created from several points on the hand and wrist.

This was an interesting chance to apply the concept of the determinantbeing the area of a given parralellipiped and worked smoothly after I realised that the coordinate system openCV2 was using had its origin in the top right of the window.<br/><br/>This sparked my interest in augmented reality as when I dove into the field to try mapping my whole body to a 3d model using Google's broader mediapipe library found that the field was incredible young still.
